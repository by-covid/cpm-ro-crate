# Common Provenance Model RO-Crate profile

Research objects, such as data, experimental results, computational models, or biological samples, are exchanged between organizations, so each of the organizations can provide provenance information only about a part of the research objectâ€™s life cycle. As a result, a complete provenance description of the object is then spread across different heterogeneous organizations. 

The [Common Provenance Model (CPM)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01537-6) provides a baseline for such distributed provenance chains. It defines how to interconnect distributed provenance parts encapsulated in PROV bundles, how to express standardized derivation paths between inputs and outputs of a process in a single bundle (so called provenance backbone), and how to attach domain specific information to the chain in a harmonized way. 

This document specifies how to identify and handle CPM compliant provenance files and CPM compliant meta-provenance files in an [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/).
